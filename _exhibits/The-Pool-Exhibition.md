<p>As seen in the image above, children in uniform swimsuits are taking part in swim lessons. This photo is from June 14th, 1966, and was utilized as publicity for the day camp that the YWCA housed. At this point in history, the YWCA had been an integrated space since 1946, a distinct and notable element of the organization, as they were on the forefront of the movement for integration. Women and children of all races shared the pool, and took part in programming that promoted women's advancement of opportunity in society. The act of learning to swim is one of privilege as it can be hard to locate and pay for swim lessons. The YWCA serviced middle class, working class Philadelphians, and it was only one of few public, indoor swimming pools this demographic had access to.

<p>This photo above is revolutionary for its time, as integrated swimming classes were almost unheard of. This exemplifies the YWCAâ€™s long standing support for inclusivity and uplifting of minority communities, and further displays the importance that the space held. As seen in this photo, a majority of the students are teens, and the YWCA put a large emphasis on creating empowering programming for young women of all races. Not only were there significant efforts for women to learn and engage in swimming, but the YWCA also offered the opportunity to become a lifeguard.
