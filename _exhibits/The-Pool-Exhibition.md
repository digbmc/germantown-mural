<p>In this brochure from the YWCA, we see the dates, employees, times, and plans for the pool in the year of 2000. Additionally, the pamphlet discusses the importance of children learning how to swim, especially for “minority” children, as it is one of the highest causes of death at the time of this being published. As shown by our oral history quotes, the pool was falling on hard times in the early 2000s, as financing became tighter and tighter. As they say in the pamphlet “almost anyone who has lived in Germantown learned to swim in this pool,” showing that its need in the community is felt by many.

<p>As seen in the image above, children in uniform swimsuits are taking part in swim lessons. This photo is from June 14th, 1966, and was utilized as publicity for the day camp that the YWCA housed. At this point in history, the YWCA had been an integrated space since 1946, a distinct and notable element of the organization, as they were on the forefront of the movement for integration. Women and children of all races shared the pool, and took part in programming that promoted women's advancement of opportunity in society. The act of learning to swim is one of privilege as it can be hard to locate and pay for swim lessons. The YWCA serviced middle class, working class Philadelphians, and it was only one of few public, indoor swimming pools this demographic had access to.

<p>This photo above is revolutionary for its time, as integrated swimming classes were almost unheard of. This exemplifies the YWCA’s long standing support for inclusivity and uplifting of minority communities, and further displays the importance that the space held. As seen in this photo, a majority of the students are teens, and the YWCA put a large emphasis on creating empowering programming for young women of all races. Not only were there significant efforts for women to learn and engage in swimming, but the YWCA also offered the opportunity to become a lifeguard.

<p>This photograph displays the various swimming programming that were available, including the option to enroll in life saving courses. It also includes the written detail that the pool provides sterilized swimwear.

Oral History Quotes About the Pool:

An interview with Arleen Olshan about her experience with using the pool as a space to meet other LGBTQ women:

Arleen Olshen: One thing I should tell you, too, that the pool, the swimming pool? On Tuesday nights, back in the day, when we were part of Radicalesbians, like in the 1970s, early 1970s, there was nude swimming there on Tuesday nights. 

Grace Roebuck: Just for women? 

Arleen Olshen: Just for women. And it was wonderful. I mean, we'd all be with our towels, and everything was really cool, and we'd all hang out. And it was both Lesbian and Straight women that went and maybe there would be like, 20 women there every Tuesday night, and it was fabulous! That Y was wonderful back in the day and it would be great to see it open again. It really would.

Grace Roebuck: That sounds amazing. Yeah.

Arleen Olshen: It's very important to gain access to it, and find out exactly what needs to be done. I mean, it's not just like, let's just unlock the doors and open the windows.  I know that there's all kinds of water damage and probably needs a new roof. The pool was falling apart back in the day, the floors were buckling. There's a lot of work to be done. If you can't get access, you can't know what the hell needs to be done.
